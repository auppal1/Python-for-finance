VaR: Value at risk
This is the potential loss in value of a risky portfolio/asset given these inputs:
- A specified time period - time frame in which we would want to measure the VaR
- A confidence level 

VaR methods

------------------------------------Parametric method-----------------------------------------
- Assumes returns follow a specific probability distribution (usually normal) using the
mean and std dev of historical returns to estimate potential losses at a given confidence level.

VaR remains a one tail test as we are only looking at potential losses

Inputs:
- Time = 1 year
- Confidence Level = 95%
    - Z-score (z) = 1.65

Stock characteristics 

mean retun (μ) = 10%
std dev (σ) = 10%

VaR = μ - (σ*z)

∴ 10%-(10%*1.65)
  10%-16.5%
= -6.5%

What does this mean?

we are looking at a 10% expected return but we are looking at our 5% percentile worst outcome
(at 0.95 CI) which gives us a return of -6.5%

What if CI increased?

Inputs:
- Time = 1 year
- Confidence Level = 99%
    - Z-score (z) = 2.33

Stock characteristics 

mean retun (μ) = 10%
std dev (σ) = 10%

VaR = μ - (σ*z)

∴ 10%-(10%*2.33)
 10% - 23.3%
= -13.3%

This moves the tail further left to the distribution, showing us the 1% percentile worst outcome 
(at 0.99 CI)of returns

-----------------------------------Historical Method------------------------------------------

Calculates VaR using historical returns, ranking them and then selecting the loss a the
desired percentile

Inputs:
- Time = 1 day
- Confidence Level = 99%

Gather returns from last 500 trading days

VaR = 100% - 99% = 1% percentile outcome

In this instance, it is the 5th lowest

-----------------------------------Monte Carlo method-----------------------------------------

methodology:
- Simulating numerous potential future price paths
- Based on assests statistical properties (μ, σ)
- Involves thousands of simulations
- Calculates potential loss/ gain for each simulation
- VaR is derived from distribution of simulated losses

Starting portfolio = $1000

mean retun (μ) = 10%
std dev (σ) = 20%

Thousands of simulations are run with these metrics. All simulations will start at $1000
but will branch off in different directions dependent on the metrics plugged in.

- Time = 1 year
- Confidence Level = 95%

After the simulations are carried out, we look at the year mark and look at the 5% percentile
of lowest transactions that have occured. 

Hypothetically, if at this confidence level, the final price is $600, that is a 40% loss
($1000-$600) 

∴ VaR = -40%
